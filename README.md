# eZmax-API

This repository contains the API documentation and definition for the eZmax and eZsign products.

For more details about these products, please visit:
- [eZmax.com](https://ezmax.com)
- [eZsign.com](https://ezsign.com)

You can find the API specification files in the `specs` directory and the HTML documentation files in the `docs` directory.

We provide two versions of the documentation:

## Full Documentation
- [eZmax API Documentation (Full)](https://ezmaxinc.github.io/eZmax-API/docs/full/ezmax.v1.2.html)
  
The full documentation encompasses all endpoints, including both current and deprecated ones. It offers a comprehensive overview of the entire eZmax API, providing detailed information on every aspect of the API's functionality.

## Partial Documentations
- [eZmax API Documentation (Ezsign)](https://ezmaxinc.github.io/eZmax-API/docs/partial/ezsign/ezmax.v1.2.html)
- [eZmax API Documentation (RemaxQC)](https://ezmaxinc.github.io/eZmax-API/docs/partial/remaxqc/ezmax.v1.2.html)
  
These customized documentation versions provide a focused insight into the API functionalities, catering to distinct projects or purposes. It's important to note that the endpoints documented in these versions are identical to those in the full documentation; however, they selectively highlight the most frequently used functionalities, ensuring developers have a streamlined reference while not encompassing the entirety of the API's capabilities.
